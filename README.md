This is a simple script written in AWK to parse the content of `forces.dat` files generated by OpenFOAM forces function object.
 ## Note:
 Currently, the script supports only the output generated by OpenFOAM foundations version (openfoam.org).

 # How to use it
* Download or clone this repo: 

```
git clone https://github.com/s1291/parseForces.git
```
* Make the script as executable:

```
chmod +x parseForces
```

The usage is as simple as running the following command:

```
./parseForces --to-csv /path/to/the/file/forces.dat > forces.csv
```

You can omit the `--to-csv` flag to get a space separated fields.
